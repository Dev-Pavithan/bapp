            <h1>Data Structures</h1>
            <p>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a
                computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for
                organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving,
                and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in
                almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about
                data structures.</p>
